# Community-Detection-in-Social-Network

One of the  most important tasks when  studying  networks is  that  of  identifyingnetwork communities.Fundamentally, communities allow us to discover groups of interacting objects(i.e.,nodes) and  the  relations  between  them.  For example, in  social  networks,  communities  correspond  to  groups  of friends  who  attended  the  same  school,  or  who  come  from the  same  hometown; in  protein  interaction  networks, communities are functional modules of interacting proteins; in co-authorship  networks,  communities  correspond  to  scientific disciplines. Identifying network communities allows us  to discover  functionally  related  objects , study interactions between modules, infer missing attribute values and predict unobserved connections.
